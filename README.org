* Cl-ownpress 

#+begin_quote
Convert inputs to outputs.
#+end_quote

To elaborate a bit further:

1. Collect inputs from anywhere. e.g tweets, local org files, Reddit/HN comments
2. Process the inputs to produce outputs e.g convert them to HTML files

That's it folks. clownpress is a general framework that shall allow you to do
just that, and only that.

It is not an "I don't know what I am doing" end-user software, it is meant to
maximize hackability. Code is the UI.
